# Mapping_Earthquakes_
Creating Interactive World Map with JavaScript
# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to virtually show the difference between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
We used the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Then, Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data. 
Each earthquake is virtually represented by a circle and color, and there are popup markers that will show the magnitude of the earthquake and location when clicked on. In addition is a legend that provides information on the colors of the earthquakes for viewers without clicking on the markers.
